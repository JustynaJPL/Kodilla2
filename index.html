    <h1>Iron Maiden - Dream of mirrors</h1>
    <p>
        <br>Have you ever felt
        <br> The future is the past
        <br> But you don't know how...?
        <br> A reflected dream
        <br> Of a captured time
        <br> Is it really now, is it really happening?
        <br>
        <br> Don't know why I feel this way
        <br> Have I dreamt this time, this place?
        <br> Something vivid comes again into my mind
        <br> And I think I've seen your face
        <br> Seen this room, been in this place
        <br> Something vivid comes again into my mind
        <br>
        <br> All my hopes and expectation
        <br> Looking for an explanation
        <br> Have I found my destination?
        <br> I just can't take no more
        <br>
        <br> The Dream is true, The Dream is true
        <br> The Dream is true, The Dream is true
        <br>
        <br> Think I've heard your voice before
        <br> Think I've said these words before
        <br> Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
        <br> Am I still inside my dream?
        <br> Is this a new reality
        <br> Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
        <br>
        <br> All my hopes and expectation
        <br> Looking for an explanation
        <br> Coming to the realisation
        <br> That I can't see for sure
        <br>
        <br> I only dream in black and white
        <br> I only dream 'cause I'm alive
        <br> I only dream in black and white
        <br> To save me from myself
        <br>
        <br> I only dream in black and white
        <br> I only dream 'cause I'm alive
        <br> I only dream in black and white
        <br> To save me from myself
        <br>
        <br> The Dream is true, The Dream is true
        <br> The Dream is true, The Dream is true
        <br>
        <br>I get up put on the light Dreading the oncoming night
        <br> Scared to fall asleep and dream
        <br> The dream again
        <br>
        <br> Nothing that I contemplate
        <br> Nothing that I can compare
        <br> To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
        <br>
        <br> Dread to think what might be stirring
        <br> That my dream is reoccurring
        <br> Got to keep away from drifting
        <br> Saving me from myself
        <br>
        <br> I only dream in black and white
        <br> I only dream 'cause I'm alive
        <br> I only dream in black and white
        <br> To save me from myself
        <br>
        <br>
